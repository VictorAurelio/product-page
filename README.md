<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #4a4a4a;">ProductPage - PHP Backend with ReactJS Frontend</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This project is a ProductPage web application with a PHP backend and a ReactJS frontend. The backend utilizes various design patterns such as DTO, DAO, QueryBuilders, Validators, Controllers, and Routers. It also includes user authentication with JWT, multiple pre-programmed queries, and a specific class for database connection, which currently supports only MySQL but can be expanded to other databases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The system includes a database service that assists with query parameter construction and search. Security and validation checks are implemented throughout the code using validators. The code adheres to the recommendations of the PSR for indentation and variable naming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The frontend is built with ReactJS and allows users to add products, delete products, and modify product information. Users can also register for the system and make changes to the product listings. The system includes error messaging and validation for all user inputs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application is styled using SASS, which enhances the project's visual appeal and maintainability.</p>
